3/4/5. The first step we took in implementing this parser was by creating a skeleton that adhered to the mC Grammar
       rules from pages 9 and 10 of the Assgn2 Writeup handout.  Robert initally started the assignment by adding
       neccessary tokens, then I added the trees to parser.y, as well as additional code to tree.c and tree.h.  
       Robert then took care of the functions from strtab.c, then debugged/added necessary code to run the program.
       In addition to using the provided examples to test the program, various random examples were used to "play
       with the program".  For example, "int main() {1+2;}" to test the operator or "int main() {1/2;}".
