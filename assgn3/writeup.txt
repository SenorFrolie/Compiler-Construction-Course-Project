1.     Danny Borja, Robert Bonham, CS 4318

2.     Met once or twice after class during the weekday, then met 1 on saturdays
        given we were able to meet if our schedules would allow it. 

3.      Both group members took part in working on each file adding little by little.
        In most cases we would meet on Discord or Zoom to screenshare what we had accomplish and 
        code together to come up with a solution. That situation happened more often than expected.
        Started with Robert intially working on the parser, then Danny with the strtab files. Then as 
        the turn in date got closer we met more regular to work together to finish the parser.

4.      One way to quick test all the code was to create a bash files testing out each of the require 
        error handling. And the ways to test the correctness of our code can be found cases folder.
