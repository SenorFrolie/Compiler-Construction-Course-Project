1. Danny Borja and Robert Bonham (both CS 4318)

2. We plan on working on this project a little bit every day.  Technologies used include Enterprise 
   and Discord for communicating.

3. Robert and I worked 50/50 on this assignment.  

4. Two ways to test include the following:
   a. Various test cases used from previous assignments.
   b. Here is an example of another test case...

program
   declList
      decl
         funDecl
            funcTypeName
               typeSpecifier,int
               identifier,main
            funBody
               localDeclList
                  varDecl
                     typeSpecifier,int
                     identifier,a
               statementList
                  statement
                     assignStmt
                        var
                           identifier,a
                        expression
                           addExpr
                              term
                                 factor
                                    int

5. Known bugs include undefined functions and a variable bug.  Sadly, I'm sure there are more.

6. Calling functions were tested using the following...

int main2(int a, int b){
	a = 0;
}

int main(){
	int i;
	int a;
	int b;

	i = 0;
	a = 0;
	while (a < 3){
		a = a + 1;
	}

	main2(i,a);
}

7. To run, enter the following...

   make clean; make
   ./obj/mcc test/cases/testfile.mC

   As a side note, we tested our code using MARS version 4.5.
